Ultralytics YOLOv8 is a cutting-edge, state-of-the-art (SOTA) model that builds upon the success of previous YOLO versions and introduces new features and improvements to further boost performance and flexibility.
Now, We have rewritten the YOLOv8 to make it simpler and easier to use. At the same time, we have tested the effectiveness of YOLOv8 in object detection for autonomous driving on the BDD100K dataset.
Finally, we designed the YOLOBI network to try to optimize the effectiveness of object detection.
